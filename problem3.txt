Binary search is a searching technique to search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval by half, and creating a binary tree. 

if the length of array is n, and iteration is k, then length of array would be n/2^k;

after k iterations, the length of array becomes 1.
Then, n = 2^k;

applying log on both sides,

log(n) = k*log(2);

therefore, k = log2(n);
